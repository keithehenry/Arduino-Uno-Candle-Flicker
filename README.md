**Simple Candle Flame Flicker**

Connect three LEDs, two yellow and one red, to the three pins identified in the source code. *Don't forget* the three ~220 Ohm current limiting resistors.

A fairly good approximation of a candel flame, expecially with some tissue paper (or similar) around it. Good enough for Halloween. :)
